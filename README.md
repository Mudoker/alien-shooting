### Controls

- Firing: The spaceship automatically fires at enemies, eliminating the need for manual input.
- Power-ups: Collect power-up items that periodically descend from the top of the screen to gain advantages such as health replenishment, enhanced firepower, and temporary invulnerability.

### Stages and Boss Encounters

- The game consists of multiple stages, each comprising three waves of enemies.
- Each stage culminates in a challenging boss encounter in the final wave.
- Players must complete each stage within a 60-second time limit to progress.

### Ship Models

- Progressing through the game unlocks access to three different spaceship models.
- For testing purposes, all ships and stages are readily available from the start in this assignment.

### Game Termination

- Failure to complete a stage within the time limit or depletion of the spaceship's health results in automatic game termination and a loss.
- To exit the game environment, players can input the letter 'x'. However, be cautious as this action will result in the loss of all progress made.
